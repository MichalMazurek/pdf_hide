This tool is an ongoing effort to bring a novel open-source method of steganography to the public. It is able to embed arbitrary data in a covert way inside any PDF file containing enough text. As a result, no one but the intented recipient suspects the existence of embedded data. The same tool can then be used to extract the concealed data.

This project stems from research conducted at the University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands, in December 2012: [Using Steganography to hide messages inside PDF files](https://www.os3.nl/_media/2012-2013/courses/ssn/using_steganography_to_hide_messages_inside_pdf_files.pdf), written by [Fahimeh Alizadeh](mailto:Fahimeh.Alizadeh@os3.nl), [Nicolas Canceill](mailto:Nicolas.Canceill@os3.nl), [Sebastian Dabkiewicz](mailto:Sebastian.Dabkiewicz@os3.nl) and [Diederik Vandevenne](mailto:Diederik.Vandevenne@os3.nl).

## Basic usage

````bash
pdf_hide -k "secret key" embed secret_data_file innocent_file.pdf
````

````bash
pdf_hide -k "secret key" extract innocent_file.pdf
````
